# Definition of Done (DoD)

## 1. Documentation Standards

Documentation must be thorough, clear, and accessible, following principles from the **IBM Writing Guide**:

- **Clarity**:
  - Documentation should be concise, providing only the necessary information in a clear format.
  - Avoid technical jargon(specialized language used by experts in a field) where possible; if jargon is required, provide definitions or explanations.
- **Structured Format**:
  - Use headings, bullet points, and lists to structure content for easy scanning and readability.
- **Audience-Focused**:
  - Documentation should cater to both technical team members and non-technical stakeholders (example, clients, end-users).
- **Comprehensive Coverage**:
  - Each module, function, and component should have associated documentation, covering its purpose, usage, parameters, and expected outputs.
  - All API endpoints should be documented, including request and response formats, parameters, and expected behavior.
- **Version Control**:
  - Documentation must be updated to reflect any changes in functionality, structure, or dependencies.

## 2. Frontend Design and User Experience

Frontend elements must follow **Laws of UX** principles to create a user-friendly experience:

- **Hick's Law (Simplicity)**:
  - User interfaces should be as simple as possible to reduce cognitive load.
  - Limit options presented to users at any given time, ensuring a clear path to task completion.
- **Fitts's Law (Accessibility)**:
  - Interactive elements (example: buttons, links) must be large enough to be easily clickable, especially on mobile devices.
  - Primary actions should be emphasized visually and placed in accessible locations on the screen.
- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**:
  - Design elements should be visually pleasing, as a well-designed interface fosters user trust and ease of use.
  - Maintain consistent color schemes, typography, and spacing throughout the application.
- **Error Prevention and Feedback**:
  - Prevent errors by guiding users through processes with clear instructions and validation.
  - Provide immediate, clear feedback for user actions, such as loading indicators, success messages, and error notifications.
- **Responsive and Accessible Design**:
  - The UI must be fully responsive, functioning well on a range of devices and screen sizes.
  - Follow accessibility standards (example: WCAG 2.1) to ensure the application is usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

## 3. Git and Version Control

- **Commit Standards**:
  - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, following the format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add user login functionality`).
  - Commits should be frequent, representing logical chunks of work, to make changes easy to track and review.
- **Branching and Merging**:
  - Every feature, bug fix, or task should be developed on its own branch.
  - Merge requests must be reviewed and approved by another team member before merging into the main branch.
- **Final Review Before Merging**:
  - Ensure all tests pass, code meets style requirements, and there are no unresolved issues in the branch.
  - Documentation must be up-to-date before merging the branch to the main project.

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing**:
  - All components that require automated testing must have associated unit tests that cover expected behavior, edge cases, and potential errors.
  - Unit tests should be automated where possible, run regularly, and pass with no failures before code merges.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Test integration points between frontend, backend, and database to ensure seamless data flow and functionality.
- **User Acceptance Testing**:
  - Before a feature is considered complete, it must be tested from the user's perspective to ensure it meets requirements and provides a positive experience.
- **Bug Tracking and Resolution**:
  - All known bugs should be documented in GitLab, and addressed promptly.
  - No critical or high-severity bugs should remain open when a feature is marked as done.
