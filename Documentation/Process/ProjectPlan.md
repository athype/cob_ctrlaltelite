## The TEAM

In a project, teamwork is the backbone of success. Smooth communication, enhanced productivity, and a professional working environment are ensured by having a shared understanding of team's expectations and responsibilities. Finding common ground gives team members clarity on their roles, duties and expectations of one another while also assisting  them in directing the team's efforts toward the project's goals.

Each member should have a clear understanding of their responsibilities which helps reduce confusion and overlap of tasks within the group. That is why every group member must agree on the [Code of Conduct](Code%20of%20Conduct.md) and take responsibility on following the given rules. 
With clear expectations, each member can be held accountable for their deliverables and performance. 
A clear communication within the group also plays an important role as a sense of belonging, making individuals feel valued and motivated to give their best in the project. 
Lastly, having common ground will minimize misunderstandings and help resolve conflicts quickly, which is very important since the deadline spare no time for problems.

Being aware of these expectations provides the team with a precise standard by which to evaluate everyone's performance. Individuals and together as a team, can be proud of each member's contribution when they meet or surpass the objectives. If issues arise, this can be seen as a reflection that provides a constructive foundation for feedbacks and improvements.
