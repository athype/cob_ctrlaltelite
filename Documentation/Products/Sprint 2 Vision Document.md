# Vision for Sprint 2

## Project Goal

Sprint 2 aims to deliver a functionally complete, integrated, and polished product with enhanced features such as transcription capabilities and improved accessibility.

## Objectives

1. Implement and integrate speech-to-text transcription using Whisper.
2. Introduce theme switching (Light/Dark/High Contrast).
3. Improve product design.
4. Refactor and modularize code.
5. Conduct extensive testing for Whisper transcription.

## Deliverables

1. **Core Functionality Enhancements:**  
   - Optimized speech-to-text transcription  
   - Improved workflows  
2. **Testing and QA:**  
   - Comprehensive testing coverage  
3. **Documentation:**  
   - Updated Functional and Technical Design  

## Framework and Technology Choices

- **Frontend:** Svelte  
- **Audio Handling:** MediaStream API  
- **Speech Recognition:** HuggingFace Whisper  
- **Database:** SQLite
