# Technical Design Final Version (v3.0)

## 1. Introduction

### Project Description
The project is focused on developing text and voice feedback features with optional voice recognition for the company Scorion.
Scorion develops a student portfolio system that aims to provide feedback not only for the final grading, but for smaller parts of each task called data points.
The data point approach allows students to get a fuller picture of their progress. For this reason, feedback is a primary focus.

### Objectives
To send feedback, Scorion currently relies on external systems, such as sending forms or using a mobile device's speech recognition tool.
For this project, Scorion wants to detach from the use of third-party servers and build their own set of feedback features.
The project is a proof of concept, so the development of the specified features is to be done separately from the existing software.

The objectives can be defined as follows:
- Provide a voice feedback feature that allows recordings to be stored.
- Provide a text input feature that allows users to type and store feedback.
- Include a voice-to-text conversion for audio feedback using Whisper from HuggingFace.
- Preserve confidentiality of users by avoiding the use of third-party services.
- Optionally explore a video feedback feature for future enhancement.

### Scope

This document describes the technical design part of the project. It explains the choice of frameworks and components, architectural decisions, and their correspondence with requirements.

### Stakeholders
- **Client**: Scorion, which formulates the requirements for the project.
- **Lecturer**: Eelco Jannink, who defines the primary frameworks to be used and serves as an intermediary in communication with the client.

## 2. General Overview and Approach

The general approach when making technical decisions is to base them on the client's requirements.
The choice of frameworks is a critical part of the project's architecture as it determines how well features can be realized and how easily they can be maintained.

Key considerations include:
- Ensuring modularity and reusability of components.
- Keeping the frontend and backend independent.
- Ensuring the system is extendable and maintainable.

---

## 3. Design Considerations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Svelte is used for its simplicity and performance.
- **Component Design**:
    - Components must be modular, reusable, and well-contextualized.
    - Styling is tied to components or applied across the entire project when appropriate.
- **User Experience**:
    - Prioritized over technical complexity.
    - The interface must be intuitive, accessible, and easy to use.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for routing and API management.
- **Design**:
    - Modular codebase for easy extension and maintenance.
    - Integration of the MediaStream API for audio recording and playback.
    - Whisper (from HuggingFace) for speech-to-text processing.
- **Performance**:
    - Focus on responsiveness and optimized algorithms.

- **MediaRecorder API**: Provides camera recorder and enables the recording of media stream.

### Information Architecture

![info_architecture.png](..%2Fmd-images%2Finfo_architecture.png)

1. Entities:
- TextFeedback: Represents text-based feedback submitted by users, with attributes for content, timestamp, and user association.
- VideoFeedback: Represents video feedback with attributes for file path, timestamp, and duration.
- AudioFeedback: Represents audio feedback with attributes for file path, timestamp, and duration.
- User: Represents users who submit feedback.

2. Relationship:
- A User can create multiple feedback entries for each feedback type (TextFeedback, VideoFeedback, and AudioFeedback).

3. Data Types:
- Audio files (e.g., `.wav`).
- Text feedback entries.

4. Data Navigation:
- Accessible via intuitive UI lists for saved audio and text feedback.

### Security Architecture
- Whisper is secure due to its ability to process data locally, ensuring privacy, reducing reliance on third-party services, supporting encryption, and providing transparency through its open-source nature.
- All data is processed and stored locally to ensure confidentiality. No third-party servers are used for sensitive data which fulfilled client's needs for security.
- No third-party servers are used for sensitive data.

### Performance

- The performance of the Whisper model depends on the variant (Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, Large). Smaller models (Tiny/Base) are faster and lightweight, suitable for near real-time transcription with moderate accuracy, using 1â€“2GB VRAM. Larger models (Medium/Large) are slower but highly accurate, requiring 10+GB VRAM and performing best for offline or high-quality transcription tasks. GPU acceleration significantly enhances speed, while CPU usage is feasible but slower.
- Audio recording and playback must be low-latency.
- Whisper integration should handle transcription efficiently, even with larger audio files.

## 6. Data Flow

![sequence_diagram.png](..%2Fmd-images%2Fsequence_diagram.png)

### Audio/Video Recording and Transcription
1. Users clicks on the record button to start audio or camera capture.
2. Audio or video is recorded and temporarily stored in the browser.
3. On saving, audio or video file will be sent to backend for storage and real-time transcription via Whisper API.
4. Transcripted text is returned to the frontend for users to edit and submit

### Feedback Submission
1. Users can preview and edit text/audio/video with transcriptions.
2. On submitting, the files will be sent to backend for validation and storage in the database.

## 7. Data Model

### Feedback Models

```
text_feedback
{
 "id": "id", 
 "feedback": "name",
 "content": "feedback_text",
 "timestamp": "created_at",
 "user_id": "user_id"
 }
```

```
video_feedback
{
 "id": "id", 
 "feedback": "name",
 "video_path": "file_path",
 "timestamp": "created_at",
 "duration": "duration"
 }
```

```
audio_feedback
{
 "id": "id", 
 "feedback": "name",
 "audio_path": "file_path",
 "timestamp": "created_at",
 "duration": "duration"
 }
```

## 8. Error Handling

### Frontend

1. Display error messages for failed recordings or API requests.
2. Display error when new feedback is empty.
3. Display error when feedback name is empty while saving.
4. Handle UI fallback for users without microphone or camera access.

### Backend

1. Validate input files and texts before processing.
2. Return understandable errors code.

Example response

```
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "E001",
  "message": "Invalid input data",
  "details": {
    "field": "feedback",
    "error": "Field is required"
  }
}
```
