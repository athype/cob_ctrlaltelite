# Functional Design

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem
Scorion currently lacks an intuitive and secure feedback system that allows students and educators to provide comprehensive feedback through multiple channels (audio, text, and video).  
The current feedback system relies on third-party services for audio recording and transcription, which raises privacy concerns and non-compliance with ISO27001 security standards.

### 1.2 Problem Analysis
- The current system only supports text feedback(recording was done externally), which lacks the clarity and depth that audio and video can provide.
- The dependency on third-party audio tools introduces security risks, potential data leaks, and breaches of privacy regulations.
- The lack of integrated audio transcription prevents users from efficiently converting their speech into text within the platform.
- Users currently cannot manage feedback efficiently, lacking features such as combining multiple types of feedback.
- There is no way to stop or resume recordings, which leads to unnecessary content being captured during interruptions.

### 1.3 Context Research
- Scorion is a digital portfolio platform tailored for students, especially in the medical field, emphasizing gradual feedback instead of end grades.
- The platform provides dashboards for students to review feedback on data points (assignments or supervised tasks).
- An integrated, privacy-compliant audio recording system will enhance the platformâ€™s usability and align with its educational goals.

## 2. Solution Overview

### 2.1 Solution Vision
The project aims to create a proof-of-concept feedback feature within Scorion that:
- Allows users to **record, store, and play audio feedback securely** using the MediaStream API.
- Provides text-based feedback input and storage.
- Supports **video feedback recording**, playback, and storage using MediaRecorderAPI.
- Enables a combined feedback feature where users can include **text, audio, and video** in a single entry.
- Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that meets accessibility standards with **theme-switching functionality** (Light, Dark, High Contrast).
- An interface with details and features that have a positive impact on statisfying user experience.

### 2.2 Scope

#### **In-Scope:**
- Audio, text, and video feedback recording, playback, and secure storage.
- Transcription of recorded audio via **Whisper** integrated into the platform.
- UI improvements to enhance usability (highlighting new feedback, visual effects, tabs/submenus, pop-up modals, indicators, easier navigation).
- Dedicated feedback page with the ability to manage feedback items.
- Combining multiple feedback types (text, audio, and video) into a single feedback entry.
- Support for another language transcription beyond English (Dutch).
- Feature for editing text feedbacks.

#### **Out-of-Scope:**
- Integration with Scorion's production environment.
- Advanced editing features (e.g., trimming audio/video).
- Transcription of video feedback to text.
- Support for more than 2 languages.

### 2.3 Requirements (Non-Functional)
- **Performance:** Ensure low-latency recording, playback, and transcription processing.
- **Security:** Fully local processing of audio and video to ensure data privacy compliance (ISO27001).
- **Usability:** A user-friendly interface that provides clear actions and workflows.
- **Scalability:** Efficient handling of audio and video storage without impacting system performance.
- **Accessibility:** Compliance with accessibility guidelines to support diverse user needs.

### 2.4 Risks and Assumptions

#### **Risks:**
- Complexity in integrating real-time transcription within the recording workflow.
- Potential storage challenges due to the growing size of audio and video files.
- UI complexity when adding combined feedback features.

#### **Assumptions:**
- SQLite will be sufficient to store metadata and feedback securely.
- Users will find the proof-of-concept sufficient without immediate integration into the existing Scorion platform.
- Whisper transcription library will handle common accents and speech variations accurately.
