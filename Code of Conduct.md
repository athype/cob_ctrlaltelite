# Team Code of Conduct

## 1. Attendance and Punctuality
- **General Attendance**: Team members are expected to attend all classes, stand-ups, and meetings on time.
- **Notifying the Team**: If a member expects to be late or absent, they must notify the team in advance with an explanation.
- **Extreme Conditions**: In case of emergencies or unavoidable circumstances, team members should inform the team as soon as possible, and no strike will be issued for such instances.
- **Strike Policy**: After three unexcused late arrivals or absences, the team may request a formal strike from the teacher.

## 2. Task Responsibility and Work Quality
- **Task Ownership**: Each team member is expected to take full responsibility for their assigned tasks and work towards completing them by the agreed deadlines.
- **Reporting Issues**: If a task feels too challenging or lacks clarity, the team member should immediately report this to the team for guidance or reallocation.
- **Handling Incomplete Tasks**: Incomplete tasks should be discussed and redistributed evenly among the team to ensure fair workload distribution.

## 3. Communication and Collaboration
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts should first be addressed within the team in a respectful, constructive manner. If the issue remains unresolved, the team should seek advice from the teacher.
- **Focus and Professionalism**: Meetings are expected to be productive and maintain a professional atmosphere. Distractions should be minimized.
- **Mandatory Stand-Ups**: Stand-ups are to be held at least twice weekly, with attendance required for all team members. Each stand-up must be documented on the same day.
- **Respectful Feedback**: Provide respectful, constructive feedback, and accept feedback graciously, using it to improve your work.
- **Response Times**: Team members are expected to respond to messages and updates within 24 hours on weekdays.

## 4. Documentation and Code Sharing
- **Project Confidentiality**: Project code and documentation must not be shared outside the team to prevent plagiarism.
- **Thorough Documentation**: Each team member must keep updated documentation of their individual and group contributions, which will be included in project submissions.

## 5. Coding Standards and GitLab Usage
- **Branching and Issues**: Each GitLab issue must have its own branch, created by the team member responsible for the issue.
- **Merging Process**: All merges must go through a merge request in GitLab and be reviewed by another team member. Conflicts must be resolved locally before merging.
- **Version Control Etiquette**:
   - Always pull the latest code before pushing new changes.
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages that reflect the changeâ€™s purpose.
   - Commit frequently to ensure easy tracking of progress and to prevent data loss.
